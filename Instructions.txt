To execute the realized activity, first of all, we have to execute the 'use_djangostack' file from djangostack folder and get into the project folder.
Then, we execute the following commands:

`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`
`python manage.py runserver`

Then, we go to the browers and we can search for the following urls:

http://localhost:8000/
http://localhost:8000/home
http://localhost:8000/accounts/login
http://localhost:8000/accounts/register
http://localhost:8000/admin

Logging in as an admin, we can see the models that we've done and work with them.
